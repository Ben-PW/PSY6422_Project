Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. Due to the timeliness of the data received from the laboratories and occurrence of public holidays there are gaps and overlaps between some of our official estimates, this does not impact the comparability of these estimates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. The rounding applied to ratios may result in credible intervals which appear to be similar to the estimate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Official reported estimates are plotted at a reference point believed to be most representative of the given week. This can vary due to  timeliness of data received from the laboratories and the occurrence of public holidays.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
