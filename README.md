## Running this code yourself

If you'd like to run this code on your device, you will need to do a bit of set up beforehand. Create a new folder in your PC and store the R code there. Within that same folder, create folders called "Data" and "Figures" (the capitalisation is important). The CSV documents located in the corresponding "Data" folders of this project should then be stored in the "Data" folder on your device. From there, you just need to run the code - the static graphs will be stored in the "Figures" folder you created and the Shiny graph will be opened in your browser.
